### About me

Hello! My name is Zhiyi Wang, and I am a junior student at ShanghaiTech University. 
My area of expertise lies in Computer Vision and Computer Graphics.
I'm familar with contemporary Deep Learning frameworks such as 
MLP, CNN, RNN, AE, GAN, and NeRF, alongside rendering techniques like rasterization and 
surface/volume rendering. Currently, I am conducting research at 
[SVIP lab](https://svip-lab.github.io/), under the esteemed guidance of 
Prof. [Shenghua Gao](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en/2020/0814/c7582a54772/page.htm).

### Projects

#### Realistic Smoke Rendering | Dec. 2022 --- Jan. 2023
A renderer supports both surface and volume rendering 
designed as the final project of Computer Graphics (CS171)
- Implemented basic Monte-Carlo \textit{Path-Tracing} for surface rendering. 
- Implemented sampler with \textit{Delta-Tracking} and transmittance estimation with Ratio-Tracking, in addition to their integration with surface rendering.
